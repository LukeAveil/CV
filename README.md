## Luke Aveil

I am a freelance photographer and adventurer turned junior developer. I have always been curious about how things are made and eager to understand how they work, this curiosity and natural inquisitiveness is what led me to become a developer.

I have just completed 16 weeks intensive training at Makers Academy, Europe's leading full stack coding bootcamp. During my time at Makers I have developed a passion for object-orientated design, clean test-driven code and working in a collaborative environment.

My journey to become a developer and has been incredible so far, full of highs and lows and everything in-between, for insight into my adventure you can read my blog [here](https://medium.com/@lukeaveil).

## Skills

#### Full stack development

Through my time spent at Makers Academy I have become proficient in working in all areas of web development. Whilst working on several collaborative projects I have focused on all aspects of the development process, these skills and experiences allow me to immediately contribute to both front-end and back-end development.

#### Ability and eagerness to learn fast

Just over four months ago I knew a limited amount of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and that was the extent of my web development knowledge. Since then I have completed projects using Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, Express.js and JavaScript. I have also learnt about concepts that I had never even heard of until a few months ago, and more importantly learnt how to follow these practices whilst developing my own projects.
