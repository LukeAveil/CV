## Luke Aveil

My background is in retail, photography and adventure, but last year I decided to pursue a passion of mine that I had always thought to be out of reach...to become a software developer. I have just completed 16 weeks intensive training at Makers Academy, Europe's leading full stack coding bootcamp. I am open to employment opportunities and look forward to applying my skills as a junior developer.

My journey to become a developer and has been incredible so far, full of highs and lows and everything in-between. For an insight into my adventure you can read my blog [here](https://medium.com/@lukeaveil).

## Skills

#### Full stack development

Through my time spent at Makers Academy I have become proficient in working in all areas of web development. Whilst working on several collaborative projects I have focused on all aspects of the development process, these skills and experiences allow me to immediately contribute to both front-end and back-end development.

#### Eagerness to learn

Being thrown in 'the deep end' every day has helped me develop the ability to learn new subjects/concepts/languages fast and efficiently. Not being afraid of learning something new, no matter how complex, has become second nature and I am always striving to further my knowledge of anything I do not fully understand.

#### Collaboration

My visual arts background means that I have had several opportunities to work on numerous collaborative projects: organising an arts festival in Thailand, photographing city suburbs in Australia and organising a street art festival in London are a few of the projects I have been part of. During my time at Makers Academy I worked on several group projects and pair programmed pretty much every day for 12 weeks. I am a firm believer that two heads are better than one.

#### Photography

Photography is a major part of my life, it was the catalyst for me being able to travel the world and call Australia home. I have been taking photographs for ten years, during that time I have developed a strong attention to detail and the ability to construct well composed images. Along with being comfortable behind the camera I have a lot of experience using Photoshop and Lightroom, and am able to learn other imaging software quickly and efficiently.
