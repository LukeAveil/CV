A freelance photographer and adventurer turned junior developer. A curiosity for code and attempt to teach myself how to program, has led me out of my comfort zone to pursue a career in something I never thought possible.

I have just completed 16 weeks intensive training at Makers Academy, Europe's leading full stack coding bootcamp. During my time at Makers I have developed a passion for object-orientated design, clean test-driven code and working in a collaborative environment.
