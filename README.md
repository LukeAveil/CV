## Luke Aveil

I am a Ruby developer that specialises in front-end technologies.

## Skills

#### Full stack development

Through my time spent at Makers Academy I have become proficient in working in all areas of web development. Whilst working on several collaborative projects I have focused on all aspects of the development process, these skills and experiences allow me to immediately contribute to both front-end and back-end development.

#### Eagerness to learn

Being thrown in 'the deep end' every day has helped me develop the ability to learn new subjects/concepts/languages fast and efficiently. Not being afraid of learning something new, no matter how complex, has become second nature and I am always striving to further my knowledge.

#### Collaboration

My visual arts background means that I have had several opportunities to work on several collaborative projects: organising an arts festival in Thailand, photographing city suburbs in Australia and organising a street art festival in London. During my time at Makers Academy I worked on various group projects and pair programmed on a daily basis, this gave me experience working with a range of different people at varying levels of expertise.
